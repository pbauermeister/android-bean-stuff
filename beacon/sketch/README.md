# Sketch

This is the Arduino sketch for the Lightblue Bean module.

It can be flashed into the Bean by one of these ways:

- On OSX, having a computer with BLE, have the Arduino IDE,
  with the Bean Loader. Open the sketch in Arduino IDE and flash the
  sketch from there. See http://legacy.punchthrough.com/bean/getting-started-osx/

- Same method on Windows. See
  http://legacy.punchthrough.com/bean/getting-started-windows/

- On any computer, edit and store the sketch in
  `Dropbox/Apps/Bean Loader/YOUR_PROJECT/YOUR_PROJECT.ino`, then on
  an iPhone/iPad, have Dropbox and the Bean Loader app. Your project
  becomes visible in the Bean Loader app. From there, compile,
  transfer and flash the sketch in one step.

- For Android, do as in the last option, but the integration with
  Dropbox is not provided, so passing the sketch file from the
  computer to the phone is much more tedious.
